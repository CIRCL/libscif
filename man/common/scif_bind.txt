NAME
----
scif_bind - Bind an endpoint to a port.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_bind(scif_epd_t* 'epd'*, uint16_t* 'pn'*);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_bind*() binds endpoint 'epd' to port 'pn', where 'pn' is a port number on the
local node. If 'pn' is zero, a port number greater than or equal to
*SCIF_PORT_RSVD* is assigned and returned. Each endpoint may be bound to
exactly one local port. Ports less than 1024 when requested can only be bound
by system (or root) processes or by processes executed by privileged users.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_bind*() returns the port number to which 'epd'
is bound; otherwise: in user mode -1 is returned and 'errno' is set to
indicate the error; in kernel mode the negative of one of the following
errors is returned.

ERRORS
------
*EBADF*::
  'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor

*EINVAL*::
  'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor, or the endpoint or the port are already bound.

*EISCONN*::
  The endpoint is already connected.

*ENOSPC*::
  No port number available for assignment (when pn==0).

*ENOTTY*::
  'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor

*EACCES*::
  The port requested is protected and the user is not the superuser.

NOTES
-----
*scif_bind*() is available in both the user mode and kernel mode SCIF libraries.
