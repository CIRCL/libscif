NAME
----
scif_recv - Receive a message.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_recv(scif_epd_t* 'epd'*, void* \*'msg'*, int len, int flags);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_recv*() receives data from the peer of endpoint 'epd'. Up to 'len' bytes of
data are copied to memory starting at address 'msg'. On successful execution
the return value of *scif_recv*() is the number of bytes that were received
and is zero if no bytes were received because 'len' was zero. *scif_recv*() may
be called only when the endpoint is in a connected state.

If a *scif_recv*() call is non-blocking, then it receives only those bytes
which can be received without waiting, up to a maximum of 'len' bytes.

If a *scif_recv*() call is blocking, then it normally returns after receiving
all 'len' bytes. If a blocking call is interrupted or the connection is
forcibly closed, the call is considered successful if some bytes were
received or 'len' is zero, otherwise the call is considered unsuccessful;
subsequent calls to *scif_recv*() will successfully receive all data sent
through peer endpoint interruption or the connection was forcibly closed.

On Linux in user mode, the *select*() and *poll*() functions can be used to
determine when data is available to be received. On Microsoft Windows* and
on Linux in kernel mode, the *scif_poll*() function may be used for this
purpose.

It is recommended that *scif_send*()/*scif_recv*() only be used for short
control-type message communication between SCIF endpoints. The SCIF RMA
APIs are expected to provide better performance for transfer sizes of
1024 bytes or longer.

The 'flags' argument is formed by ORing together zero or more of the following
values:

*SCIF_RECV_BLOCK*::

    Block until the entire message is received.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_recv*() returns the number of bytes
received; otherwise: in user mode -1 is returned and errno is set to
indicate the error; in kernel mode the negative of one of the following
errors is returned.

ERRORS
------
*EAGAIN*::
 The destination node is returning from a low power state.
*EBADF*::
 'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor .
*ECONNRESET*::
 A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.
*EFAULT*::
 An invalid address was specified for a parameter.
*EINVAL*::
 'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor, or
 'flags' is invalid, or
 'len' is negative.
*ENODEV*::
 The remote node is lost.
*ENOMEM*::
 Not enough space.
*ENOTCONN*::
 The endpoint is not connected.
*ENOTTY*::
 'epd' is not a valid endpoint descriptor.

NOTES
-----
*scif_recv*() is available in both the user mode and kernel mode SCIF libraries.
