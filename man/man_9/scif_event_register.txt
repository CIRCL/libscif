SCIF_EVENT_REGISTER(9)
======================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
scif_event_register - Register an event handler.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_event_register(scif_callback_t* 'handler');*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_event_register*() registers a routine, 'handler', to be called when some
event occurs. The 'event' parameter to 'handler' indicates the type of event
which has occurred, and the corresponding component of the 'data' parameter to
'handler' provides additional data about the event.

The following events are defined:

*SCIF_NODE_ADDED*::
A node has been added to the SCIF network. The
 'scif_node_added' component of the 'data' parameter to 'handler' identifies the
 node. This event is informational. There are no requirements on the event
 handler.
*SCIF_NODE_REMOVED*::
A node is being removed from the SCIF network. The
 'scif_node_removed' component of the 'data' parameter to 'handler' identifies the
 node. Upon being called, and before returning, the event handler must
 return, using *scif_put_pages*(), all structures obtained using
 *scif_get_pages*() against an endpoint connected to the lost node. It is
 recommended and expected that the handler will also *scif_close*() all
 endpoints connected to the lost node.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion *scif_event_register*() returns 0; otherwise: 
the negative of one of the following errors is returned.

ERRORS
------
*ENOMEM*::
 There was no space to allocate file descriptor tables.

NOTES
-----
*scif_event_register*() is only available in the kernel mode SCIF library.

SEE ALSO
--------
*scif_event_unregister*(3), *<scif.h>*
