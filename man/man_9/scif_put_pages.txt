NAME
----
scif_put_pages - Remove references from remote registered pages.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <scif.h>*

*int scif_put_pages(
       struct scif_range* \*'pages'*);*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*scif_put_pages*() releases a 'scif_range' structure previously obtained by
calling *scif_get_pages*(). The physical pages represented by 'pages' may
be reused when the window which represented those pages is unregistered.
Therefore, those pages must not be accessed after calling *scif_put_pages*().

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon successful completion, *scif_put_pages*() returns 0; otherwise the
negative of one of the following errors is returned.

ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
 'pages' does not point to a valid 'scif_range' structure, or
 the 'scif_range' structure pointed to by 'pages' was already returned.
*ENODEV*::
 The remote node is lost.
*ENOTCONN*::
 The endpoint is not connected.

NOTES
-----
*scif_put_pages*() is only available in the kernel mode SCIF library.

SEE ALSO
--------
*scif_get_pages*(3), *<scif.h>*
